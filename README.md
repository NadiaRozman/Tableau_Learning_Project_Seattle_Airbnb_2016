# 🏙️ My First Tableau Dashboard: Seattle Airbnb (2016)

This project is my **first Tableau dashboard**, created as part of my learning journey to understand Tableau fundamentals. By following a tutorial by [Alex The Analyst](https://youtu.be/j8FSP8XuFyk?si=zbIaI6K7dtr0HOte), I explored Airbnb listings in Seattle in 2016 to practice building clear, interactive visualizations.

The goal of this dashboard is to examine **how prices and revenues vary across neighborhoods** and **by number of bedrooms**, while learning how to design an intuitive dashboard for exploratory analysis.

## 📊 About the Dashboard

**Title:** Seattle Airbnb Analysis – 2016  
**Tool:** Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public  
**Data Source:** See `/data/README.md`  
**Author:** Nadia Rozman

The dashboard includes:
- **Average Price per Bedroom** – to see how nightly rates change with room size  
- **Revenue Over Time** – tracking revenue trends throughout 2016  
- **Price by ZIP Code** – geographic variation across Seattle neighborhoods  
- **Bedroom Count Distribution** – highlighting the most common property types

---

## 🔍 Key Observations

- Larger listings (5–6 bedrooms) generally have the highest nightly rates  
- Revenue increased steadily in the first half of 2016 before stabilizing
- Certain ZIP codes consistently show higher average prices, highlighting popular neighborhoods  
- The majority of listings are 1-bedroom properties
